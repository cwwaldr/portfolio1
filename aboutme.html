  <h6 style= "size:large" style= "color:purple"> Python Reflection
    <p4 style= "color: white">Scratch is definitely a simplified version of coding where all of the pieces and functions are all there for you.  This helped to make me understand the general idea of what coding is and ow it works.  Scratch was very easy to use and it was easy to figure out my mistakes.  O the other hand, I ran into lots of trouble today with python, while it is similar to scratch in concept, i found it much more difficut.  Mainly, I struggle with python due to overthinking and because the functions and pieces were not laid out for me like they were in scratch, there was more thinking for me to do.  However, when I did get debug my code with lots of help from Nada, all my frustration went away and my mind opened up!  i felt from then on like i could handle python and iam very proud of that!</p4>
